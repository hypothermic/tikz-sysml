# TikZ-SysML

Utilities for drawing SysML diagrams in LaTeX using TikZ.
My goal is to implement all diagram types from the SysML 1.0 spec with this package,
even if they overlap with the TikZ-UML package.
This is to provide consistency in theming, since the constructs from these packages will differ.
